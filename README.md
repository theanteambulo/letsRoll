# LetsRoll

Your challenge is to build an app that helps users roll dice then store the results they had.

- You should have a tab view where the first tab lets users roll dice, and the second tab shows results from previous rolls.
- Let the user customize the dice that are rolled: how many of them, and what type: 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, 20-sided, and even 100-sided.
- Show the total rolled on the dice.

When I say “roll dice” you don’t need to create fancy 3D effects – just showing the numbers that were “rolled” is fine.

To do later (maybe):

- Store the results using Core Data so they are persistent.
- Add haptic feedback when dice are rolled.
- Make the value rolled by the dice flick through various possible values before settling on the final figure.
